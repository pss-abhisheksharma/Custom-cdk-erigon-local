# RPC Trace Compare Tool

This tool compares transaction traces between two Ethereum nodes (local and remote) to ensure consistency and detect discrepancies.

It also needs debugToolsConfig, here an example of it: [debugToolsConfig.yaml](../../../debugToolsConfig.yaml.example)

Run the command with the appropriate configuration:
```sh
go run zk/debug_tools/rpc-trace-compare/main.go
```
